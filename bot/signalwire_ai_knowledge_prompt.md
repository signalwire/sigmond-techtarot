# SignalWire AI Knowledge Prompt

## Company Overview

SignalWire is a revolutionary communication technology company founded by the creators of FreeSWITCH. The company has created and leads the **Programmable Unified Communications (PUC)** category, representing the next evolution of business communications by eliminating traditional barriers like vendor lock-in, fragmented tools, and high costs.

**Mission**: Make communication programmable, composable, and easy to manage, enabling limitless innovation.

**Vision**: Enable businesses to own the experience of their communication infrastructure without the burden of managing hardware.

## Core Value Proposition

SignalWire is the only platform that combines:
- **CPaaS flexibility** for custom applications
- **UCaaS capabilities** for unified communications
- **CCaaS functionality** for contact centers
- **Native AI integration** for conversational experiences
- **Sub-800ms latency** for natural interactions

## Key Revolutionary Features

### 1. Ultra-Low Latency Conversational AI (~500ms)
SignalWire achieves industry-leading response times through:
- **Native "bare metal" integration**: Direct connection between telephony infrastructure and AI models
- **Parallel processing**: Speech-to-text, language model inference, and text-to-speech run simultaneously
- **Minimal network hops**: Architectural design eliminates unnecessary middleware
- **Result**: Natural, human-like conversations without awkward pauses

### 2. Programmable Unified Communications (PUC)
SignalWire's groundbreaking PUC platform solves three critical problems:
- **Avoids rigid on-premise systems**: No expensive hardware required
- **Fixes fragmented cloud services**: All communication channels in one platform
- **Prevents high DIY costs**: Enterprise-grade capabilities without building from scratch

### 3. SWML (SignalWire Markup Language)
A declarative language for orchestrating communication:
- **Simple yet powerful**: YAML/JSON-based workflow definition
- **Real-time updates**: Modify active conversations dynamically
- **Web-like paradigms**: Familiar development patterns for rapid adoption
- **Universal application**: Works across voice, video, messaging, and AI

### 4. SWAIG (SignalWire AI Gateway)
Serverless function framework for AI agents:
- **Function-based execution**: AI can call external tools during conversations
- **Tool integration**: Connect to CRMs, databases, APIs without complex webhooks
- **DataMap tools**: API integrations that run on SignalWire's servers
- **Low-latency operation**: Direct integration with telephony stack

### 5. Revolutionary SDK Features
The SignalWire Agents SDK introduces groundbreaking capabilities:

**Skills System**: Add complex capabilities with one-line calls:
```python
agent.add_skill("web_search")
agent.add_skill("datetime")
agent.add_skill("native_vector_search", {"index_file": "knowledge.swsearch"})
```

**DataMap Tools**: Create API integrations without webhook infrastructure
**Local Search**: Offline document search with vector similarity

### 6. Transparent Barge (Unique Feature)
The only platform offering natural interruption handling:
- Users can interrupt AI agents at any time
- System adapts as naturally as a human would
- Context is preserved during interruptions
- Seamless continuation or redirection based on user input

## Competitive Advantages

### vs. Traditional CPaaS (Twilio, Vonage, etc.)
- **No stitching required**: Native AI integration vs. external bolted-on solutions
- **3-5x faster response times**: Sub-800ms vs. 2000ms+ latency
- **Unified platform**: Single vendor for voice, video, messaging, and AI
- **Lower total cost**: No multiple vendor fees and integration costs

### vs. Voice AI Platforms
- **No infrastructure dependencies**: Others rely on Twilio/LiveKit for telephony
- **Better latency**: Direct integration eliminates extra network hops
- **Enterprise-ready**: SOC II, HIPAA compliant, global scaling built-in
- **Complete solution**: No need to manage multiple vendors

### FreeSWITCH Evolution
While FreeSWITCH powers many major platforms (Five9, Amazon Connect, Zoom Phone), SignalWire takes it to the next level:
- Native AI with telecom background
